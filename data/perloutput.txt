AB  - DS86760016 is a new leucyl-tRNA-synthetase inhibitor at the preclinical
      development stage. DS86760016 showed potent activity against extended-spectrum
      multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical samples and in 
      vitro biofilms. In a murine catheter-associated urinary tract infection model,
      DS86760016 treatment resulted in significant eradication of P. aeruginosa from
      the kidney, bladder, and catheter without developing drug resistance. Our data
      suggest that DS86760016 has the potential to act as a new drug for the treatment 
      of Pseudomonas infections.

      The SUPERIOR multicentre study.

AB  - Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) present a high risk of developing an
      infection caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Consequently, new
      antimicrobials and combinations are required. In this study, the activity of
      ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) was evaluated against Enterobacterales (n=400) and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=80) clinical isolates collected from patients in
      Spanish ICUs with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated
      intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). Overall susceptibility to C/T in P. aeruginosa
      isolates by infection type was 95.7% in cUTI (MIC50/90, 1/4 mg/L) and 85.3% in
      cIAI (MIC50/90, 1/64 mg/L). Activity against P. aeruginosa was maintained
      regardless of its resistance pattern, confirming that C/T is one of the best
      antipseudomonal agents along with colistin and amikacin. Susceptibility to C/T in
      Enterobacterales by infection type was 79.5/81.9% and 89.3/92.3% (EUCAST/CLSI) in
      cIAI and cUTI isolates, respectively. Activity was excellent against wild-type
      organisms, with 100% susceptible and inhibited at MIC </=1 mg/L. Nevertheless,
      C/T susceptibility decreased against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
      (ESBL)-producing isolates: Escherichia coli (80.4/84.8% susceptible by
      EUCAST/CLSI) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (59.1/77.3% susceptible by EUCAST/CLSI).
      No activity of C/T was observed in carbapenemase-producing isolates. The in vitro
      activity of C/T observed in this surveillance study suggests that this agent can 
      be considered as a therapeutic option for cUTI and cIAI due to Enterobacterales
      and P. aeruginosa in ICU patients, particularly when carbapenemase-producing
      isolates are not involved.

TI  - Plazomicin: A Novel Aminoglycoside for the Treatment of Resistant Gram-Negative
      Bacterial Infections.
PG  - 243-269
LID - 10.1007/s40265-019-1054-3 [doi]
AB  - Plazomicin is a novel semisynthetic parenteral aminoglycoside that inhibits
      bacterial protein synthesis. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration for use in adults with complicated urinary tract infections
      (cUTI), including pyelonephritis. Plazomicin displays potent in vitro activity
      against Enterobacteriaceae, including both extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant isolates. Plazomicin's enhanced
      Enterobacteriaceae activity is due to its stability to commonly encountered
      aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that compromise the activity of traditional
      aminoglycosides. Plazomicin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is via modification 
      of the ribosomal binding site due to expression of 16S rRNA methyltransferases.
      Plazomicin does not display improved activity over traditional aminoglycosides
      against other problematic resistant Gram-negative bacteria, namely Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Plazomicin has been assessed in two phase
      III randomized controlled trials. The EPIC trial compared plazomicin and
      meropenem for the management of cUTI. In this trial, plazomicin demonstrated
      superiority in composite cure (81.7% vs 70.1%; difference 11.6%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 2.7-25.7) at the test-of-cure visit, which was driven by enhanced
      sustained microbiological eradication. The CARE trial compared plazomicin-based
      and colistin-based combinations in patients with serious infections due to
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). In this analysis, plazomicin-based
      combinations were associated with numerically decreased mortality or serious
      disease-related complications when compared with colistin-based combinations
      (23.5% vs 50%, respectively; 90% CI -0.7 to 51.2). Furthermore, plazomicin was
      also associated with a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity than colistin. However, 
      small sample sizes limit the interpretation of the findings in the CARE trial.
      Plazomicin is a novel aminoglycoside that offers clinicians an additional option 
      for the management of CRE infections, with superior activity compared with
      traditional aminoglycosides and potentially improved efficacy and decreased
      toxicity compared with colistin.

AB  - The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens has become a 
      serious worldwide health concern. Gram-negative bacteria such as
      Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp.,) 
      Acinetobacter spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have rendered most antibiotics
      inactive, leaving aminoglycosides and polymyxins. Plazomicin (formerly ACHN-490),
      is a neoglycoside with unique structural modifications to the aminoglycoside
      pharmacophore that impart activity against many MDR Gram-negative organisms.
      ACHN-490 was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the
      treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by MDR
      Enterobacteriaceae. In this era of increasing Gram-negative resistance, it is
      imperative to critically evaluate new antibiotics so that we understand how to
      use them optimally. The objective of this article is to discuss available data
      detailing plazomicin's biochemistry, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      characteristics, in-vitro activity and current progress in clinical trials. In
      addition, plazomicin's potential role in therapy for the treatment of MDR
      Gram-negative infections will be discussed.

AB  - Epidemiology and prevention of health care associated infections. Nosocomial
      infections (NI) are infections contracted in a healthcare facility. This
      definition has become unsuited to current care practices where initially the
      distinguishing criterion was the place of acquisition of infection (nosocomial
      versus community). It has therefore been updated in November 2007 and was
      integrated more broadly within healthcare associated infections. The prevalence
      of nosocomial infections (NI) in France is located in the lower limits of other
      countries in Europe around 5.3%. The most frequent infections are urinary tract
      infections, pneumonia, surgical site infection and bloodstream infection. These
      NI are favored by the presence of invasive devices or invasive procedures.
      Bacteria represent the most frequently microorganisms isolated in NI. The most
      commonly involved are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. The major problem of these bacteria is the multidrug resistance (eg, 
      S. aureus resistant to methicillin). NI prevention is based on greater respect
      for hygiene precautions. The NI remains a public health major concern both in
      terms of morbidity and mortality cost.

TI  - A New Approach for Improving the Antibacterial and Tumor Cytotoxic Activities of 
      Pipemidic Acid by Including It in Trimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin.
LID - E416 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20020416 [doi]
AB  - Pipemidic acid (HPPA) is a quinolone antibacterial agent used mostly to treat
      gram-negative infections of the urinary tract, but its therapeutic use is limited
      because of its low solubility. Thus, to improve drug solubility, natural
      cyclodextrins (CDs) are used for their ability of including guest molecules
      within their cavities. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antibacterial
      activity and the preliminary anticancer activity of HPPA included into Heptakis
      (2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (TRIMEB) as a possible approach for a new 
      innovative formulation. The inclusion complex of HPPA with TRIMEB was prepared in
      solid state by the kneading method and confirmed by FT-IR and powered X-ray
      diffraction. The association in aqueous solutions of pipemidic acid with TRIMEB
      was investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Job's plots have been drawn by
      UV-visible spectroscopy to confirm the 1:1 stoichiometry of the host(-)guest
      assembly. The antibacterial activity of HPPA, TRIMEB and of their complex was
      tested on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphilococcus aureus.
      The complex was able to increase 47.36% of the median antibacterial activity of
      the free HPPA against E. coli (IC50 = 249 microM vs. 473 microM). Furthermore,
      these samples were tested on HepG-2 and MCF-7. After 72 h, the median tumoral
      cytotoxicity exerted by the complex was increased by 78.08% and 94.27% for HepG-2
      and MCF-7 respectively, showing a stronger bioactivity of the complex than the
      single HAPPA.

TI  - Efficacy of intravesical targeting of novel quorum sensing inhibitor
      nanoparticles against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-associated murine
      pyelonephritis.
PG  - 995-1003
LID - 10.1080/1061186X.2019.1574802 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-associated pyelonephritis is a severe infection
      that can lead to mortality. There are no strategies that can effectively manage
      this infection since the pathogenesis is controlled by quorum sensing (QS)
      regulated virulence and recalcitrant biofilms. QS inhibitors (QSIs) are emerging 
      therapeutics against such infections but are associated with cytotoxicity or low 
      bioactivity. Hence, we developed novel quorum sensing inhibitor loaded
      nanoparticles (QSINPs) using the biopolymers, chitosan (CS) and dextran sulphate 
      (DS) and were intravesically targeted against biofilm-associated murine
      pyelonephritis. The in-vivo targeting of QSINPs was confirmed by tracking the
      fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) tagged QSINPs in bladder and kidney of mice. On
      characterising, the QSINPs showed a size of 685.7 nm with a zeta potential of
      37.9 and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
      indicated spherical shape and bioactivity assays indicated QSI activity till 8
      months. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis indicated possibility of
      isothiocyanate bonding in CS with DS and with QSI. The QSINPs showed excellent in
      vitro antivirulence activity by reducing the virulence factors and biofilm of P. 
      aeruginosa and in vivo therapeutic efficacy with ciprofloxacin (CIP). Hence, we
      propose a novel next-generation therapeutic and its appropriate targeting route
      against biofilm-associated pyelonephritis.

AB  - Infectious urolithiasis is a consequence of long-standing urinary tract
      infections with urease-positive bacteria, especially Proteus spp. However,
      because of the often mixed nature of urinary tract infections, in the case of
      urinary stones formation, several species of bacteria may be involved in the
      process. The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of the bacterial
      species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus on the crystallization caused by
      Proteus mirabilis. The studies were conducted in synthetic urine with the
      addition of P. mirabilis and a representative of another species. During the
      experiments the viability of bacteria, pH, presence and morphology of crystals,
      and the intensity of crystallization were assessed. Crystallization of calcium
      and magnesium phosphates occurred in all investigated configurations. However,
      there were differences observed in the course and intensity of crystallization
      between the mixed culture and the P. mirabilis culture. Although most intense
      crystallization took place in the pure culture of P. mirabilis it was also
      demonstrated that the presence of other uropathogens increased the survival of P.
      mirabilis. This synergistic effect could be responsible for the persistence and
      recurrence of urolithiasis in the urinary tract.

AB  - Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a combination of an antipseudomonal cephalosporin and a
      beta-lactamase inhibitor. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was approved by the US Food and 
      Drug Administration in 2014 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2015 for use 
      in adults to treat complicated urinary tract infections, acute pyelonephritis,
      and complicated intra-abdominal infections with metronidazole. Studies for
      paediatric indications are planned. The Programme to Assess
      Ceftolozane-Tazobactam Susceptibility monitors the resistance of
      ceftolozane-tazobactam to Gram-negative isolates worldwide. In total, 6240
      Gram-negative isolates were collected between 2012 and 2016 from paediatric
      patients (<18 years old) in 31 US hospitals (4207 isolates) and 48 European
      hospitals (2033 isolates), and tested for susceptibility (S) to
      ceftolozane-tazobactam by broth microdilution. Other antibiotics tested included 
      amikacin, colistin and meropenem. The most common infection type in hospitalized 
      paediatric patients was pneumonia (n=2018), followed by urinary tract infection
      (n=1569) and bloodstream infection (n=1236). In total, 4316 Enterobacteriaceae
      and 1765 non-enterics were isolated. The most common species were Escherichia
      coli (n=1919), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1236) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=709).
      In all regions, the three most active antimicrobials against paediatric
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates were amikacin (99.0%S), meropenem (98.9%S) and
      ceftolozane-tazobactam (94.6%S). For all P. aeruginosa, colistin (98.9%S) and
      ceftolozane-tazobactam (97.4%S) were the most active. In conclusion, for all
      Enterobacteriaceae, ceftolozane-tazobactam was the most potent cephalosporin
      tested, with only meropenem and colistin having higher susceptibility rates. For 
      P. aeruginosa, ceftolozane-tazobactam was the most potent beta-lactam and had a
      similar susceptibility rate to colistin.

TI  - Portable bacteria-capturing chip for direct surface-enhanced Raman scattering
      identification of urinary tract infection pathogens.
PG  - 180955
LID - 10.1098/rsos.180955 [doi]
AB  - Acute urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common nosocomial
      bacterial infections, which affect almost 50% of the population at least once in 
      their lifetime. UTIs may lead to lethal consequences if they are left undiagnosed
      and not properly treated. Early, rapid and accurate uropathogens detection
      methods play a pivotal role in clinical process. In this work, a portable
      bacteria-grasping surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) chip for
      identification of three species of uropathogens (Escherichia coli CFT 073,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Proteus mirabilis PRM1) directly from culture
      matrix was reported. The chip was firstly modified with a positively charged NH3 
      (+) group, which enables itself grasp the negatively charged bacterial cells
      through the electrostatic adsorption principle. After the bacterial cells were
      captured by the chip, concentrated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were used to obtain
      their Raman fingerprint spectra with recognizable characteristic peaks and good
      reproducibility. With the help of chemometric method such as discriminant
      analysis (DA), the SERS-based chip allows a rapid, successful identification of
      three species of UTI bacteria with a minimal bacterial concentration (10(5) cells
      ml(-1)) required for clinical diagnostics. In addition, this chip could spot the 
      bacterial SERS fingerprints information directly from LB culture medium and
      artificial urine without sample pre-treatment. The portable bacteria-grasping
      SERS-based chip provides a possibility for fast and easy detection of
      uropathogens, and viability of future development in healthcare applications.

TI  - Epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial infection in the respiratory
      intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in China: A prospective surveillance
      during 2013 and 2015.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial
      infection (NI) in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of a teaching
      hospital in Northwest China. METHODS: An observational, prospective surveillance 
      was conducted in the RICU from 2013 to 2015. The overall infection rate,
      distribution of infection sites, device-associated infections and pathogen in the
      RICU were investigated. Then, the logistic regression analysis was used to test
      the risk factors for RICU infection. RESULTS: In this study, 102 out of 1347
      patients experienced NI. Among them, 87 were device-associated infection. The
      overall prevalence of NI was 7.57% with varied rates from 7.19 to 7.73% over the 
      3 years. The lower respiratory tract (43.1%), urinary tract (26.5%) and
      bloodstream (20.6%) infections accounted for the majority of infections. The
      device-associated infection rates of urinary catheter, central catheter and
      ventilator were 9.8, 7.4 and 7.4 per 1000 days, respectively.The most frequently 
      isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (20.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (16.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.7%). Multivariate analysis showed that the
      categories D or E of Average Severity of Illness Score (ASIS), length of stay
      (10-30, 30-60, >/=60 days), immunosuppressive therapy and ventilator use are the 
      independent risk factors for RICU infection with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of
      1.65 (95% CI: 1.15~2.37), 5.22 (95% CI: 2.63~10.38)), 2.32 (95% CI: 1.19~4.65),
      8.93 (95% CI: 3.17~21.23), 31.25 (95% CI: 11.80~63.65)) and 2.70 (95% CI:
      1.33~5.35), respectively. CONCLUSION: A relatively low and stable rate of NI was 
      observed in our RICU through year 2013-2015. The ASIS-DE, stay >/=10 days,
      immunosuppressive therapy and ventilator use are the independent risk factors for
      RICU infection.

AB  - Catheter-associated infections still represent a challenging thread because of
      the likelihood of biofilm formation. The aim of this work was the surface
      modification of catheters to immobilize lysozyme and acylase under mild
      conditions while preserving antimicrobial and anti-quorum sensing performances.
      Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was grafted onto poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) catheters
      by a pre-irradiation method. The effects of monomer concentration,
      pre-irradiation dose, reaction time, monomer concentration and reaction
      temperature were investigated. The grafting process was monitored using FTIR-ATR 
      spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and 
      swelling data. Lysozyme was directly immobilized onto PVC-g-GMA maintaining the
      hydrolytic activity, which hindered Staphylococcus aureus adhesion. For acylase
      immobilization, the PVC-g-GMA catheters were reacted with ethylenediamine and
      glutaraldehyde in order to facilitate acylase covalent binding. Free acylase in
      solution demonstrated notably capability to act as quorum sensing inhibitor, as
      observed using Chromobacterium violaceum as biosensor, by degrading a wide
      variety of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), including those produced by
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Acylase-immobilized PVC-g-GMA
      catheters were challenged against degradation of AHLs and the activity monitored 
      using both the biosensor and HPLC-MS. Relevantly, the functionalized catheters
      completely degraded all tested AHL signals, opening new ways of preventing
      biofilm formation on medical devices.

TI  - Direct Identification of Pathogens in Urine by Use of a Specific Matrix-Assisted 
      Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Spectrum Database.

AB  - Urinary tract infections are among the most common reasons for antimicrobial
      treatment, and early diagnosis could have a significant impact by enabling rapid 
      administration of the adapted antibiotic and preventing complications. The
      current delay between sample receipt and pathogen identification is about 24 to
      48 h, which could be significantly shortened by use of an accurate direct method.
      Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
      (MALDI-TOF MS) is already used for the identification of pathogens in clinical
      laboratories and constitutes a promising tool for direct diagnosis. A simple
      preparation protocol was established for the processing of urine samples prior to
      MS analysis. MALDI-TOF spectra collected directly from 1,000 infected urine
      samples were used to create a specific reference database (named Urinf). A
      prospective study was then carried out to evaluate the Urinf database and compare
      the results obtained with the standard database provided by Bruker on the
      Biotyper Real Time Classification software. Seven hundred eighty urine specimens 
      were processed and analyzed according to our method. Among them, almost 90% of
      500 infected monobacterial samples could be correctly diagnosed with the Urinf
      database, compared to 50% using the standard database. The identification of
      Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium was
      greatly improved but not for Staphylococcus epidermidis The creation of a
      database adapted to a particular type of clinical sample has great potential to
      increase both the rate and rapidity of pathogen identification. Sensitivity still
      remains to be improved for bacterial species that exhibit few specific peaks on
      mass spectra.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous microorganism that commonly causes
      hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream and urinary tract 
      infections and it is well known for chronically colonising the respiratory tract 
      of patients with cystic fibrosis, causing severe intermittent exacerbation of the
      condition. P. aeruginosa may appear in the free form cell but also grows in
      biofilm communities adhered to a surface. An alternative to conventional
      antimicrobial agents are nanoparticles that can act as carriers for antibiotics
      and other drugs. In this context, the study aimed to characterise and verify the 
      anti-biofilm potential of GML Nanocapsules against P. aeruginosa. The
      nanocapsules showed a mean diameter of 190.7nm, polydispersion index of 0.069,
      the zeta potential of -23.3mV. The microdilution test showed a MIC of 62.5mug/mL 
      to GML and 15.62mug/mL to GML Nanocapsules. The anti-biofilm experiments
      demonstrated the significant reduction of biomass, proteins, polysaccharide and
      viable P. aeruginosa in biofilm treated with GML Nanocapsules while the free GML 
      did not cause an effect. The AFM images showed a decrease in a biofilm which
      received GML. The positive results suggest an alternative for the public health
      trouble related to infections associated with biofilm.

      Mortality risk factors.
PG  - 358-362
LID - 10.1111/iju.13872 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical risk factors for death within 30 days of
      diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-causing bacteremia after a urinary tract
      infection. METHODS: A total of 62 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated
      from both urine and blood at the same episode from January 2009 to December 2016 
      were enrolled in the present study. We retrospectively investigated clinical risk
      factors for death by comparison between surviving patients and those who died
      within 30 days after diagnosis of P. aeruginosa bacteremia. The comparison for
      risk factors for bacteremia-related death included 31 categories, such as age,
      laboratory data, underlying diseases, clinical history, history of surgery, care 
      in the intensive care unit, P. aeruginosa susceptibility to the antibiotics used 
      at the time of bacteremia diagnosis and consultation with urological department. 
      RESULTS: The study included 48 men and 14 women aged 71.3 +/- 10.4 years. Nine
      patients (14.5%) died of P. aeruginosa bacteremia. Statistical analysis showed
      that non-survivors had significantly lower albumin levels than survivors (2.07
      +/- 0.62 vs 2.62 +/- 0.65; P = 0.023). The non-survivors had significantly higher
      rates of ventilator use, history of heart disease, septic shock and lower rates
      of consultation with urological departments after diagnosis (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with bacteremia complicating urinary infection by P.
      aeruginosa have a low death rate. Earlier intervention by urologists might
      improve patients' outcome. Lower albumin levels, ventilator use, history of heart
      disease and septic shock are factors associated with higher mortality rate.

TI  - Risk factors and prognosis of complicated urinary tract infections caused by
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hospitalized patients: a retrospective multicenter
      cohort study.
PG  - 2571-2581
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S185753 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) are among the most frequent
      health-care-associated infections. In patients with cUTI, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      deserves special attention, since it can affect patients with serious underlying 
      conditions. Our aim was to gain insight into the risk factors and prognosis of P.
      aeruginosa cUTIs in a scenario of increasing multidrug resistance (MDR). Methods:
      This was a multinational, retrospective, observational study at 20 hospitals in
      south and southeastern Europe, Turkey, and Israel including consecutive patients 
      with cUTI hospitalized between January 2013 and December 2014. A mixed-effect
      logistic regression model was performed to assess risk factors for P. aeruginosa 
      and MDR P. aeruginosa cUTI. Results: Of 1,007 episodes of cUTI, 97 (9.6%) were
      due to P. aeruginosa. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were: antipseudomonal
      cephalosporins 35 of 97 (36.1%), aminoglycosides 30 of 97 (30.9%),
      piperacillin-tazobactam 21 of 97 (21.6%), fluoroquinolones 43 of 97 (44.3%), and 
      carbapenems 28 of 97 (28.8%). The MDR rate was 28 of 97 (28.8%). Independent risk
      factors for P. aeruginosa cUTI were male sex (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.60-4.27), steroid
      therapy (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.10-5.27), bedridden functional status (OR 1.79, 95% CI
      0.99-3.25), antibiotic treatment within the previous 30 days (OR 2.34, 95% CI
      1.38-3.94), indwelling urinary catheter (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.43-4.08), and
      procedures that anatomically modified the urinary tract (OR 2.01, 95% CI
      1.04-3.87). Independent risk factors for MDR P. aeruginosa cUTI were age (OR
      0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and anatomical urinary tract modification (OR 4.75, 95%
      CI 1.06-21.26). Readmission was higher in P. aeruginosa cUTI patients than in
      other etiologies (23 of 97 [23.7%] vs 144 of 910 [15.8%], P=0.04), while 30-day
      mortality was not significantly different (seven of 97 [7.2%] vs 77 of 910
      [8.5%], P=0.6). Conclusion: Patients with P. aeruginosa cUTI had
      characteristically a serious baseline condition and manipulation of the urinary
      tract, although their mortality was not higher than that of patients with cUTI
      caused by other etiologies.

PG  - 145-155

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Continuous antimicrobial resistance surveillance is recommended by
      Public Health authorities. We up-dated data from the SMART (Study for Monitoring 
      Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance study in Spain. METHODS: The
      antimicrobial susceptibility data and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)
      production in isolates recovered from intra-abdominal (IAI) (n=1,429) and urinary
      tract (UTI) (n=937) infections during the 2016- 2017 SMART study in 10 Spanish
      hospitals were analysed. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most frequently
      microorganism isolated (48.3% and 53.7%) followed by Klebsiella spp. (11.5% and
      21.9%) in IAIs and UTIs, respectively. Figures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
      9.0% and 6.1%, being more frequently recovered from patients with nosocomial
      infections. Overall, 9.9% (IAI) and 14.0% (UTI) of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and
      Proteus mirabilis isolates were ESBL-producers, being Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (34.5%) from UTI of nosocomial origin the most frequent. ESBL-producers were
      higher in patients >60 years in both IAIs and UTIs. As in previous years,
      amikacin (96.3%-100% susceptibility), ertapenem (84.2%-100%) and imipenem (70.3%-
      100%) were the most active antimicrobials tested among Enterobacterales species. 
      The activity of amoxicillin-clavulanic, piperacillin-tazobactam, and
      ciprofloxacin susceptibility was lower, particularly among ESBL-producers.
      Ertapenem susceptibility (88.9%-100%) was retained in ESBL-E. coli isolates that 
      were resistant to these antimicrobials but decreased (28.6%-100%) in similar
      isolates of K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous antimicrobial resistance
      surveillance from the SMART study reveals overall maintenance of ESBL-producers
      in Spain, although with higher presence in isolates from UTIs than from IAIs.
      Moreover, ertapenem activity was high in E. coli irrespective of ESBL production 
      but decreased in K. pneumoniae, particularly among ESBL-producers.

TI  - Intra-Vesical Colistin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Urinary Tract Infections.
PG  - 000996
LID - 10.12890/2019_000996 [doi]
AB  - The numbers of multiple drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are
      rising worldwide. The threat is increased by the lack of new antibiotics, so
      clinicians are turning to older drugs previously abandoned due to their
      recognized toxicity, such as colistin. However, the need to avoid kidney toxicity
      from colistin has led to its topical use. We present the case of a patient with
      type I cardiorenal syndrome with cystitis due to multiple drug-resistant
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa who was successfully treated with intravesical
      instillation of colistin. LEARNING POINTS: The case report is one of the few in
      the literature on the intravesical instillation of colistin to address lower
      urinary tract infection.Isolated intravesical colistin instillation was effective
      in a patient with anuria.

TI  - Infectious Complications After Laser Vaporization of Urinary Stones During
      Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery Are Not Associated with Spreading of Bacteria into 
      Irrigation Fluid but with Previous Use of Fluoroquinolones.
LID - S2405-4569(19)30053-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euf.2019.02.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of infectious complications after retrograde
      intrarenal surgery (RIRS) is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
      spreading of bacteria into irrigation fluid and blood during RIRS for stone
      management and to correlate such spreading with infectious complications. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From January to December 2017, 38 patients who
      underwent RIRS for stones in two urological units were enrolled in this
      prospective, longitudinal cohort study. INTERVENTION: A urine culture was taken
      before surgery and antimicrobial prophylaxis was given in line with the European 
      Association of Urology guidelines. Blood and irrigation fluid samples were
      collected at the start of the endoscopic procedure and every 30min during the
      procedure. All samples were microbiologically examined and findings were compared
      with clinical data. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Symptomatic
      and asymptomatic urinary tract infectious complications were correlated with
      microbiological and clinical data, using Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test.
      RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Ten patients showed significant bacterial growth in
      irrigation fluid samples (seven Escherichia coli, two Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 
      one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Eight patients (21%) got febrile urinary tract
      infections during hospital stay: two had bacterial growth in the irrigation fluid
      (25%) and one also had bacteremia (12.5%). No correlation was found either
      between the bacterial growth in the irrigation fluid samples and the urine
      cultures that were taken before the procedure, or between the bacterial growth in
      the irrigation fluid samples and the development of postoperative infectious
      complications. Previous use of fluoroquinolones and a history of urinary tract
      infections were associated with infectious complications after RIRS. CONCLUSIONS:
      We demonstrated spreading of bacteria into the irrigation fluid during RIRS
      procedures, but this spreading was not associated with the development of
      infectious complications. Particular attention should be given to previous
      antibiotic treatment before administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis. PATIENT 
      SUMMARY: Bacterial spreading into irrigation fluid is a common finding during
      retrograde intrarenal surgery, but it is not associated with infectious
      complications after the procedure. Particular attention should be given to
      previous antibiotic treatment before administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

TI  - Cefiderocol: A Siderophore Cephalosporin with Activity Against
      Carbapenem-Resistant and Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacilli.
PG  - 271-289
LID - 10.1007/s40265-019-1055-2 [doi]
AB  - Cefiderocol is an injectable siderophore cephalosporin discovered and being
      developed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Japan. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, 
      the principal antibacterial/bactericidal activity of cefiderocol occurs by
      inhibition of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to
      penicillin binding proteins; however, it is unique in that it enters the
      bacterial periplasmic space as a result of its siderophore-like property and has 
      enhanced stability to beta-lactamases. The chemical structure of cefiderocol is
      similar to both ceftazidime and cefepime, which are third- and fourth-generation 
      cephalosporins, respectively, but with high stability to a variety of
      beta-lactamases, including AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).
      Cefiderocol has a pyrrolidinium group in the side chain at position 3 like
      cefepime and a carboxypropanoxyimino group in the side chain at position 7 of the
      cephem nucleus like ceftazidime. The major difference in the chemical structures 
      of cefiderocol, ceftazidime and cefepime is the presence of a catechol group on
      the side chain at position 3. Together with the high stability to
      beta-lactamases, including ESBLs, AmpC and carbapenemases, the microbiological
      activity of cefiderocol against aerobic Gram-negative bacilli is equal to or
      superior to that of ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem, and it is active against
      a variety of Ambler class A, B, C and D beta-lactamases. Cefiderocol is also more
      potent than both ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem versus Acinetobacter
      baumannii, including meropenem non-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      isolates. Cefiderocol's activity against meropenem-non-susceptible and Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriales is comparable or
      superior to ceftazidime-avibactam. Cefiderocol is also more potent than both
      ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem against all resistance phenotypes of
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The current
      dosing regimen being used in phase III studies is 2 g administered intravenously 
      every 8 h (q8 h) using a 3-h infusion. The pharmacokinetics of cefiderocol are
      best described by a three-compartment linear model. The mean plasma half-life
      (t(1/2)) was ~ 2.3 h, protein binding is 58%, and total drug clearance ranged
      from 4.6-6.0 L/h for both single- and multi-dose infusions and was primarily
      renally excreted unchanged (61-71%). Cefiderocol is primarily renally excreted
      unchanged and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustment
      is thus required for both augmented renal clearance and in patients with moderate
      to severe renal impairment. In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have
      reported that as with other cephalosporins the pharmacodynamic index that best
      predicts clinical outcome is the percentage of time that free drug concentrations
      exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC). In vivo efficacy of
      cefiderocol has been studied in a variety of humanized drug exposure murine and
      rat models of infection utilizing a variety of MDR and extremely drug resistant
      strains. Cefiderocol has performed similarly to or has been superior to
      comparator agents, including ceftazidime and cefepime. A phase II prospective,
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial assessed the safety and
      efficacy of cefiderocol 2000 mg q8 h versus imipenem/cilastatin 1000 mg q8 h,
      both administered intravenously for 7-14 days over 1 h, in the treatment of
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI, including pyelonephritis) or acute
      uncomplicated pyelonephritis in hospitalized adults. A total of 452 patients were
      initially enrolled in the study, with 303 in the cefiderocol arm and 149 in the
      imipenem/cilastatin arm. The primary outcome measure was a composite of clinical 
      cure and microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, that is, 7 
      days after the end of treatment in the microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT)
      population. Secondary outcome measures included microbiological response per
      pathogen and per patient at early assessment (EA), end of treatment (EOT), TOC,
      and follow-up (FUP); clinical response per pathogen and per patient at EA, EOT,
      TOC, and FUP; plasma, urine and concentrations of cefiderocol; and the number of 
      participants with adverse events. The composite of clinical and microbiological
      response rates was 72.6% (183/252) for cefiderocol and 54.6% (65/119) for
      imipenem/cilastatin in the MITT population. Clinical response rates per patient
      at the TOC visit were 89.7% (226/252) for cefiderocol and 87.4% (104/119) for
      imipenem/cilastatin in the MITT population. Microbiological eradication rates
      were 73.0% (184/252) for cefiderocol and 56.3% (67/119) for imipenem/cilastatin
      in the MITT population. Additionally, two phase III clinical trials are currently
      being conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Japan. The two trials are evaluating the
      efficacy of cefiderocol in the treatment of serious infections in adult patients 
      caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and evaluating the
      efficacy of cefiderocol in the treatment of adults with hospital-acquired
      bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia or healthcare-associated
      pneumonia caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Cefiderocol appears to be well
      tolerated (minor reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal and phlebitis
      related), with a side effect profile that is comparable to other cephalosporin
      antimicrobials. Cefiderocol appears to be well positioned to help address the
      increasing number of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant and MDR
      Gram-negative bacilli, including ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing strains
      (including metallo-beta-lactamase producers). A distinguishing feature of
      cefiderocol is its activity against resistant P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, S.
      maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia.

TI  - Impact of syndrome-specific antimicrobial stewardship interventions on use of and
      resistance to fluoroquinolones: An interrupted time series analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are often prescribed unnecessarily and are an
      important risk factor for infection with fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative 
      bacilli and Clostridioides difficile. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental 
      study to determine the impact of sequential syndrome-specific stewardship
      interventions on use of and resistance to fluoroquinolones in a tertiary care
      hospital. An initial 2-year intervention focused on reducing treatment of
      asymptomatic bacteriuria and ensuring concordance of urinary tract infection
      treatment with guidelines. A second 5-year intervention focused on limiting
      overuse of fluoroquinolones for health care-associated pneumonia in conjunction
      with a formal stewardship program. The primary outcomes were fluoroquinolone use 
      and changes in use over time analyzed by segmented regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      The asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection intervention resulted in
      a significant reduction in fluoroquinolone use, with a significant change from an
      increasing to a decreasing rate of use (change in slope of quarterly defined
      daily doses/1,000 patient days -15.3, P < .01). The health care-associated
      pneumonia intervention resulted in a continued significant reduction in
      fluoroquinolone use (rate ratio=0.68, P < .01). During the interventions,
      fluoroquinolone susceptibility increased significantly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      but not in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or C difficile. CONCLUSIONS:
      Antimicrobial stewardship interventions focused on specific syndromes may be
      effective in reducing fluoroquinolone use. In our hospital, reduction in
      fluoroquinolone use resulted in increased fluoroquinolone susceptibility in P
      aeruginosa, but not other Enterobacteriaceae or C difficile.

TI  - Extracted chitosan disrupts quorum sensing mediated virulence factors in Urinary 
      tract infection causing pathogens.
LID - ftz009 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femspd/ftz009 [doi]
AB  - Quorum sensing (QS) plays an important role during the aetiology of urinary tract
      infection (UTI), as several virulence factors are under the regulation of QS.
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, the primary causative agents of
      UTI, employ acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) as signal molecules to coordinate
      various virulence factors. In this present study, chitosan extracted from the
      marine crab Portunus sanguinolentus was screened for its ability to inhibit the
      QS-signaling molecules of P. aeruginosa (PA01) and few clinical isolates of P.
      aeruginosa and S. marcescens. The extracted chitosan on comparison with a
      commercial chitosan showed significant inhibition of several QS-dependent
      virulence factors in P. aeruginosa and S. marscenes. Furthermore, qPCR analysis
      was carried out to confirm the down-regulation of fimA, fimC and flhD genes
      involved in adhesion and pathogenesis of S. marcescens and lasI and rhlI genes
      that governs the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing system. Moreover, the chitosan when
      coated on a catheter was also able to disrupt the mature biofilms which was
      revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Collectively, the present study
      showcases the QS inhibitory property of extracted chitosan from crab shells which
      is being discarded as a recalcitrant biowaste.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative pathogen, associated with a
      severe mortality rate. It is also difficult to treat due to numerous resistance
      mechanisms to a wide range of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the activity of
      pexiganan, an antimicrobial peptide, in combination with two clinical antibiotics
      (azithromycin and tigecycline) that are not active against P. aeruginosa.
      METHODS: Ten clinical P. aeruginosa were isolated from urinary tract infections, 
      blood culture, skin infections and respiratory tract infections. Minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and synergies were evaluated by broth
      microdilution, checkerboard assays and time-kill studies. In vitro synergy was
      confirmed with an in vivo experiment using a murine model of sepsis. RESULTS:
      Pexiganan MICs were included between 2 and 16 mg/L. Tigecycline and azithromycin 
      MICs were high as expected (4-64 mg/L and 32-256 mg/L, respectively). Pexiganan
      and azithromycin combination resulted to be additive or indifferent while
      tigecycline and pexiganan combination was synergic against seven out of ten P.
      aeruginosa and additive against the other strains. In vivo experiment confirmed
      the in vitro synergy, denoting a significative reduction of bacteria in mice
      treated with pexiganan and tigecycline combination. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial
      peptides are molecules that could be useful in the fight against infections and
      pexiganan seems to be one of the most promising. Our results demonstrated that,
      in association with tigecycline, pexiganan administration could overcome
      antibiotic resistance and increase the effectiveness of treatment against P.
      aeruginosa sepsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are one of the most
      common types of hospital-acquired infections that start with bacterial adhesion
      and lead to biofilm formation. The antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria 
      against pathogenic organisms makes them important for medical applications.
      OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the precise method for purification of
      bacteriocin from Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. argentoratensis SJ33, and its
      characterization and effectiveness for biofilm inhibition on urinary catheters
      coated with bacteriocin. METHODS: Purification of bacteriocin was carried out
      using various methods such as cell adsorption-desorption, gel permeation
      chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Bacteriocin
      preparation was analysed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) and further characterised by Tricine SDS-PAGE and Q-TOF ESI
      MS. Antibacterial activity of bacteriocin was assessed against 16 different
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, and their effect on morphology
      was observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biofilm adherence and
      inhibition were evaluated by crystal violet assay, fluorescence microscopy and
      SEM. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocin preparation exhibited broad-spectrum
      activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and SEM analysis 
      revealed membrane pore formation. On treating with various enzymes, bacteriocin
      was found to be sensitive to proteases, which confirmed its proteinaceous nature.
      Bacteriocin showed its applicability at acidic pH in the urinary tract.
      Antibiofilm activity of bacteriocin established its significance in
      catheter-associated biofilm inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      Staphylococcus aureus. Molecular weight of bacteriocins, namely Bac F1 and Bac F2
      as resolved by RP-HPLC, was estimated to be 4039 Da and 1609 Da, respectively.

TI  - Transmission of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa between two flexible 
      ureteroscopes and an outbreak of urinary tract infection: the fragility of
      endoscope decontamination.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Flexible endoscopes are difficult to decontaminate, and
      endoscope-associated infections are increasing. This report describes an outbreak
      of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified following an increase
      in incidence of clinical infections associated with flexible ureteroscopy at a
      tertiary care centre in the UK. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and central
      decontamination unit (CDU) records were reviewed to determine the extent of the
      problem, and links to the used endoscopes. Audits of the ureteroscopy procedure, 
      endoscopy unit and CDU were performed. Endoscopes were sampled, cultured and
      examined for structural integrity. All available isolates were typed. RESULTS:
      Thirteen patients developed clinical infections linked to two flexible
      ureteroscopes. The first ureteroscope was likely colonized from a known infected 
      patient and the second ureteroscope after use on another patient infected by the 
      first. Risk factors identified include surface cuts, stretching and puckering of 
      the outer cover in both ureteroscopes, absence of bedside cleaning, overnight
      delay between the ureteroscopy and decontamination, inadequate drying after
      decontamination and non-traceability of connector valves. CONCLUSIONS: The
      adequacy of flexible endoscope decontamination depends on numerous steps. With
      the increasing global incidence of multi-drug resistant organisms, stringent
      monitoring of the flexible endoscopy process by users and decontamination units
      is essential.

PG  - 277-9
AB  - We investigated the microbial contamination of 0.02% benzalkonium chloride
      solution used in catheter kits for intermittent self-catheterization. Of 20
      samples examined, 12 (60.0%) were contaminated with 8.8 x 10(2)-3.1 x 10(6)
      colony-forming units (cfu)/mL. The contaminants were Pseudomonas fluorescens,
      Burkholderia cepacia, and Aeromonas spp. These results showed that 0.02%
      benzalkonium chloride solution used for the lubrication/disinfection of catheters
      for self-catheterization is susceptible to contamination. Therefore, the
      lubricant/disinfectant for catheters for self-catheterization was changed from
      0.02% benzalkonium chloride solution to 84-87% glycerin containing 0.02%
      benzalkonium chloride, and microbial contamination of the latter in catheter kits
      for self-catheterization was reinvestigated. Of 42 samples, 5 (11.9%) were
      contaminated with 20-2.0 x 10(4) cfu/mL. However, the rate of contamination of
      84-87% glycerin containing 0.02% benzalkonium chloride was significantly lower
      than that of 0.02% benzalkonium chloride solution (P<0.0001). The contaminant of 
      84-87% glycerin containing 0.02% benzalkonium chloride was Bacillus spp. in all
      contaminated samples. In this survey, neither contaminants of 0.02% benzalkonium 
      chloride solution nor the contaminant of 84-87% glycerin containing 0.02%
      benzalkonium chloride were the causative microbial species of urinary tract
      infection.

TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of drugs for urinary tract infections by
      genotyping based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
PG  - 353-7
AB  - We attempted to determine whether the same bacterium isolated from patients with 
      urinary tract infections (UTI) before and after treatment with antimicrobial
      agents was of the same strain ("persisted") or of a different strain ("changed").
      Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for UTI, we
      investigated whether bacterial strains could be classified as persisted or
      changed based on their electrophoretic patterns in pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE). We examined eight species of bacteria ( Enterococcus
      avium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, 
      Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and
      Escherichia coli), consisting of 41 strains (19 pairs isolated before and after
      treatment with antimicrobial agents) isolated from patients with complicated UTI.
      It was concluded that all bacteria were unchanged, based on the clinical effect
      on bacteriuria. The chromosomal DNA of these bacteria was digested with
      restriction enzymes and classified based on their electrophoretic pattern in
      PFGE. A comparison of the patterns of the fragments revealed that 14 pairs were
      indistinguishable before and after treatment, 3 pairs were closely related, 1
      pair was possibly related, and 1 pair was different. These results demonstrated
      that 18 pairs of isolates (indistinguishable, closely related, and possibly
      related) were highly likely to be continued infections by the same strain, and
      that 1 pair (different) had been replaced by another strain. Based on these
      results, we believe that bacterium genotyping by PFGE is a more effective method 
      for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens is a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium that provides 
      nutrients for growth and induces systemic resistance against plant diseases. It
      has been linked with a number of human diseases including nosocomial infections
      and bacterial cystitis. Chemotactic motility of P. fluorescens towards root
      exudates plays a crucial role in establishing a symbiotic relationship with host 
      plants. The P. fluorescens chemotactic transducer of amino acids type B (CtaB)
      mediates chemotaxis towards amino acids. As a step towards elucidation of the
      structural basis of ligand recognition by CtaB, we have produced crystals of its 
      recombinant sensory domain and performed their X-ray diffraction analysis. The
      periplasmic sensory domain of CtaB has been expressed, purified, and crystallized
      by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as a
      precipitating agent. A complete data set was collected to 2.2 A resolution using 
      cryocooling conditions and synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to space
      group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 34.5, b = 108.9, c = 134.6 A.
      Calculation of the Matthews coefficient and the self-rotation function using this
      data set suggested that the asymmetric unit contains a protein dimer. Detailed
      structural analysis of CtaB would be an important step towards understanding the 
      molecular mechanism underpinning the recognition of environmental signals and
      transmission of the signals to the inside of the cell.

TI  - Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli infections in a tertiary care hospital in
      kolar, karnataka.
PG  - 62-6
AB  - AIM: Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), which are saprophytic in
      nature, have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens. They exhibit
      resistance not only to beta lactam and the other groups of antibiotics, but also 
      to carbapenems. This study was undertaken to identify the nonfermenters isolated 
      from various clinical samples, to assess their clinical significance, to know the
      type of healthcare-associated infections they caused, and to know their
      anti-microbial sensitivity pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nonfermenters were
      identified using a standard protocol that included tests for motility, oxidase
      production, oxidation-fermentation test for various sugars, gelatin liquefaction,
      and growth on 10% lactose agar. The clinical significance was assessed by using
      various criteria and susceptibility testing was performed with the help of the
      Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 193 NFGNB were isolated
      from 189 clinical specimens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common
      nonfermenter, accounting for 53.8%, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (22.2%), 
      and Pseudomonas fluorescens (10.8%). Other significant NFGNB isolated were:
      Sphingobacterium species (5.2%), Acinetobacter lwoffii (3.1%), and
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.6%). P. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to
      imipenem (94%), cefoperazone (70%), amikacin (69%), and ticarcillin (63%). A.
      baumannii showed 100% sensitivity to imipenem and 70% sensitivity to
      piperacillin. CONCLUSION: P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were the common NFGNB
      isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, bacteremia,
      surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia. P. aeruginosa
      showed good sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone while A.
      baumannii showed good sensitivity to imipenem and piperacillin.

TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of imipenem/cilastatin and cefotaxime for
      treatment of lung, soft tissue, and renal infections.
PG  - S452-7
AB  - Thirty-one moderately or severely ill hospitalized patients with proved (25
      patients) or suspected (six) bacterial infections were randomly allocated to
      receive imipenem/cilastatin (16) or cefotaxime (15). The median age, sex,
      duration of therapy, underlying disease, and types of infection were similar in
      both groups. Nineteen patients with pneumonia, eight with soft tissue infection, 
      and four with acute pyelonephritis were included. The pathogens isolated included
      Escherichia coli (six), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five), Streptococcus pyogenes
      (five), Haemophilus species (four), Proteus species (three), Staphylococcus
      aureus (three), and Serratia marcescens (two). In the imipenem/cilastatin group, 
      13 patients were cured of their infections and three showed improvement. In the
      cefotaxime group, nine were cured, three showed improvement, and three showed no 
      improvement. Nine patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin developed phlebitis, 
      as compared with eight treated with cefotaxime. One patient treated with
      cefotaxime developed diarrhea. During therapy, potential pathogens were isolated 
      from four patients in the imipenem/cilastatin group (Candida species [two] and
      Pseudomonas maltophilia [two]), as compared with eight in the cefotaxime group
      (enterococci [two], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [two], Candida species [two],
      Acinetobacter anitratus [one], and Pseudomonas fluorescens [one]). There were no 
      recognized superinfections.

TI  - The pathogenic potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens MFN1032 on enterocytes can be
      modulated by serotonin, substance P and epinephrine.
PG  - 983-90
LID - 10.1007/s00203-015-1135-y [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas fluorescens is a commensal bacterium present at low level in the
      human digestive tract that has also been reported in many clinical samples
      (blood, urinary tract, skin, lung, etc.) and sometimes associated with acute
      opportunistic infections. It has recently been found that the human
      beta-defensin-2 can enhance the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens. In this
      study, we evaluated the effect of other intestinal molecules (5HT, SP and Epi) on
      growth and virulence of the clinical strain P. fluorescens MFN1032. We found that
      P. fluorescens MFN1032 growth was not mainly affected by these factors, but
      several modifications in the virulence behavior of this bacterium were observed. 
      5HT, SP and Epi were able to modulate the motility of P. fluorescens MFN1032. 5HT
      and SP had an effect on pyoverdin production and IL-8 secretion, respectively.
      Infection of Caco-2/TC7 cells with P. fluorescens MFN1032 pretreated by SP or Epi
      enhanced the permeability of the monolayers and led to a partial delocalization
      of F-actin to the cytoplasm. These findings show that some intestinal molecules
      can modulate the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens MFN1032. We can
      hypothesize that this dialogue between the host and the human gut microbiota may 
      participate in health and disease.

TI  - Pseudomonas mendocina native valve infective endocarditis: a case report.
PG  - 275
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative microorganisms are uncommon pathogens responsible for
      infective endocarditis. Pseudomonas mendocina, a Gram-negative water-borne and
      soil-borne bacterium, was first reported to cause human infection in 1992. Since 
      then, it has rarely been reported as a human pathogen in the literature. We
      describe the first case of native valve infective endocarditis due to P.
      mendocina in the USA. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old white man presented with
      bilateral large leg ulcers, fever, and marked leukocytosis. His past medical
      history included gout and chronic alcohol use. P. mendocina was isolated from his
      blood cultures. A comprehensive review of P. mendocina infection in the
      literature was performed. A total of eight cases of P. mendocina infection were
      reported in the literature. More than two-thirds of the cases of P. mendocina
      septicemia were associated with native valve infective endocarditis. Thus, an
      echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated mitral valve endocarditis with mild
      mitral insufficiency. His leg wounds were debrided and were probably the source
      of P. mendocina bacteremia. Unlike Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. mendocina is
      susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Our patient received a 6-week
      course of antimicrobial therapy with a favorable clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our reported case and literature review illuminates a rare bacterial cause of
      infective endocarditis secondary to P. mendocina pathogen. Native cardiac valves 
      were affected in all reported cases of infective endocarditis, and a majority of 
      affected heart valves were left-sided. The antibiotics active against P.
      mendocina are different from those that are active against P. aeruginosa, and
      they notably include third-generation cephalosporins. The outcome of all reported
      cases of P. mendocina was favorable and no mortality was described.

TI  - Pseudomonas oryzihabitans sepsis in a 1-year-old child with multiple skin rashes:
      a case report.
PG  - 77
LID - 10.1186/s13256-017-1230-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas oryzihabitans is a Pseudomonas bacterial organism rarely 
      implicated in human infections. The bacterium has been isolated in a few reported
      cases of neurosurgical infections and patients with end-stage cirrhosis, sickle
      cell disease, and community-acquired urinary tract infections. Limited
      information exists in developing countries, however, because of the lack of
      advanced microbiological tools for identification and characterization of this
      bacterium. This case report describes the isolation of a rare Pseudomonas
      bacterium in a patient presenting with sepsis and skin infection. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 1-year-old girl was presented to a hospital in the northeastern
      part of Ghana with a 1-week history of pustular rashes on her scalp and neck,
      which occasionally ruptured, along with discharge of yellowish purulent fluid.
      The child is of Mole-Dagbon ethnicity and hails from the northern part of Ghana. 
      Pseudomonas oryzihabitans was identified in the patient's blood culture using the
      16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing technique. The rash on the
      patient's scalp and skin resolved after continuous treatment with gentamicin
      while her condition improved clinically. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests the
      potential of this bacterium to cause disease in unsuspected situations and
      emphasizes the need to have evidence for the use of the appropriate antibiotic in
      clinical settings, particularly in rural settings in Africa. It also brings to
      the fore the unreliability of conventional methods for identification of
      Pseudomonas bacteria in clinical samples and thus supports the use of 16S
      ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid in making the diagnosis.

TI  - Flavimonas oryzihabitans (Pseudomonas oryzihabitans; CDC group Ve-2) bacteremia
      in the immunocompromised host.
PG  - 603-4
AB  - Flavimonas oryzihabitans, known previously as Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, and a
      member of the Centers for Disease Control group Ve-2, is a gram-negative organism
      that has rarely been implicated as a human pathogen. Flavimonas oryzihabitans
      appears to be a soil and saprophytic organism that survives in moist environments
      and is indigenous to rice paddles. To our knowledge, only seven cases of human
      infection caused by this organism have been reported; they involved four patients
      with bacteremia and three patients with peritonitis who were receiving continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In this report, we describe three
      immunocompromised patients with catheter-associated bacteremia: a patient with
      cancer, a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and a patient with
      sickle cell disease. There is emerging clinical evidence that F oryzihabitans
      should be recognized as an organism that is capable of causing human disease,
      particularly in immunocompromised patients and with the increased usage of
      permanent catheters.

TI  - Recurrent recovery of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans strains in a karstified chalk
      aquifer.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - Pseudomonas oryzihabitans is an uncommon pathogen that may cause
      catheter-associated infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
      Although it has been isolated from environment, the source of human infection is 
      not well documented. In the present study, 14 isolates of P. oryzihabitans were
      recovered over a 28-month period from a karstified chalk aquifer, allowing to
      advance that distributed natural water could be a source of contamination.
      Microbiological analyses showed that the bacterium was mainly associated with
      suspended particulate matters. To investigate the clonality of P. oryzihabitans
      environmental isolates, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, antibiogram and randomly
      amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typings were performed. Results demonstrated (i)
      the presence of at least three clones within the aquifer and (ii) that the
      presence of the bacterium in groundwater is not only the result of a biofilm
      bloom but also of an exogenous contamination.

TI  - Infection of hickman catheter by Pseudomonas (formerly flavimonas) oryzihabitans 
      traced to a synthetic bath sponge.
PG  - 4577-9
AB  - Pseudomonas (formerly Flavimonas) oryzihabitans is an uncommon pathogen that may 
      cause catheter-associated infections. Although it has occasionally been isolated 
      from the environment, the source of human infection has not previously been
      documented. We describe an AIDS patient who developed Pseudomonas oryzihabitans
      bacteremia due to colonization of a Hickman catheter. The patient reported having
      strictly followed the recommendations for catheter hygiene. The only flaw
      detected was the use of a synthetic bath sponge in the shower. The sponge was
      cultured and yielded P. oryzihabitans among other nonfermentative, gram-negative 
      bacilli. To determine the prevalence of P. oryzihabitans in sponges, we cultured 
      15 samples from unrelated households. The microorganism was isolated from 3 of
      the 15 samples. Molecular typing by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) was performed
      with the environmental and clinical isolates. Three different profiles were
      obtained for the six isolates analyzed from the patient's sponge. The strain from
      the AIDS patient was identical to one of those from his sponge and was different 
      from all the remaining strains. The AP-PCR typing results were subsequently
      confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. It can be concluded that sponges
      are occasionally colonized by P. oryzihabitans. For the first time a probable
      source of an indwelling catheter contamination with this bacterium has been
      found. Patients carrying these devices should avoid using sponge-like materials, 
      as these are suitable environments for nonfermentative, gram-negative bacilli.

TI  - Mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones and carbapenems in Pseudomonas
      putida.
PG  - 643-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas putida is an uncommon opportunistic pathogen, usually
      susceptible to antimicrobial agents. Data concerning resistance to antimicrobial 
      agents in clinical P. putida isolates are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones, carbapenems and other antibiotics were
      characterized in five clinical isolates of P. putida recovered from different
      patients with urinary tract infections as causative pathogens. Fluoroquinolone
      and carbapenem resistance were characterized genetically by the methods of PCR
      and DNA sequencing. Outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles were characterized by
      SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: Four of five isolates were resistant or intermediate to both
      fluoroquinolones and carbapenems. Nucleotide sequences in the quinolone
      resistance-determining regions suggested that amino acid mutations such as
      Thr-83-->Ile in GyrA and Glu-469-->Asp in GyrB may contribute to high resistance 
      to fluoroquinolones. Four metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates that showed
      resistance to carbapenems carried the IMP-type metallo-beta-lactamase genes. A
      combined effect of reduced production of 46 kDa OMP and metallo-beta-lactamase
      production was shown by a P. putida isolate exhibiting the highest MICs of
      carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified mechanisms of resistance to
      fluoroquinolones and carbapenems in clinical P. putida isolates.

TI  - Metallo beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas species--a major cause of concern
      among hospital associated urinary tract infection.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - Multidrug resistant pseudomonas strains are isolated in high frequency from
      urinary samples in hospitalised patients. With the occurrence of extended
      spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa being increasingly reported worldwide, this study
      evaluated the resistance pattern of pseudomonad strains to carbapenam and other
      antipseudomonal antibiotics isolated from patients with hospital associated
      urinary tract infections along with clinical usefulness of various MBL screening 
      methods (combined disc diffusion test, E-test and modified Hodge test). Presence 
      of ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases in the isolates was also determined. Of the 87
      isolates, 81 (93.1%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 (4.6%) were Pseudomonas
      putida, 2 (2.3%) were Burkholderia cepacia. Thirty-one isolates (35.6%) were
      resistant to imipenem and 61% of these 31 isolates, were MBL producers by
      combined disc diffusion test, while 48% were detected by E-test method. Overall, 
      in 30% and 54% strains, production of AmpC and ESBL respectively was observed.

TI  - A putative ABC transporter, hatABCDE, is among molecular determinants of
      pyomelanin production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
PG  - 5962-71
LID - 10.1128/JB.01021-10 [doi]
AB  - Pyomelanin overproduction is a common phenotype among Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      isolates recovered from cystic fibrosis and urinary tract infections. Its
      prevalence suggests that it contributes to the persistence of the producing
      microbial community, yet little is known about the mechanisms of its production. 
      Using transposon mutagenesis, we identified factors that contribute to
      melanogenesis in a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa. In addition to two enzymes 
      already known to be involved in its biosynthesis (homogentisate dioxygenase and
      hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase), we identified 26 genes that encode
      regulatory, metabolic, transport, and hypothetical proteins that contribute to
      the production of homogentisic acid (HGA), the monomeric precursor of pyomelanin.
      One of these, PA14_57880, was independently identified four times and is
      predicted to encode the ATP-binding cassette of an ABC transporter homologous to 
      proteins in Pseudomonas putida responsible for the extrusion of organic solvents 
      from the cytosol. Quantification of HGA production by P. aeruginosa PA14 strains 
      missing the predicted subcomponents of this transporter confirmed its role in HGA
      production: mutants unable to produce the ATP-binding cassette (PA14_57880) or
      the permease (PA14_57870) produced substantially less extracellular HGA after
      growth for 20 h than the parental strain. In these mutants, concurrent
      accumulation of intracellular HGA was observed. In addition, quantitative
      real-time PCR revealed that intracellular accumulation of HGA elicits
      upregulation of these transport genes. Based on their involvement in homogentisic
      acid transport, we rename the genes of this operon hatABCDE.

TI  - IMP-12, a new plasmid-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase from a Pseudomonas putida
      clinical isolate.
PG  - 1522-8
AB  - A Pseudomonas putida strain showing broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams,
      including expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, was isolated from a
      patient with a urinary tract infection at the University Hospital of Varese in
      northern Italy. The isolate was found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase activity 
      and to harbor a 50-kb plasmid, named pVA758, carrying a new bla(IMP) determinant,
      named bla(IMP-12). Plasmid pVA758 was not self-transferable by conjugation to
      either Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but could be introduced by
      electroporation and maintained in the latter host, where it conferred resistance 
      or decreased susceptibility to various beta-lactams. The IMP-12 enzyme is quite
      divergent from other IMP variants: its closest relatives are IMP-8 and IMP-2 (89 
      and 88% sequence identity, respectively), and IMP-1 is 85% identical to IMP-12.
      The bla(IMP-12) determinant is carried on an integron-borne gene cassette whose
      attC recombination site is related to those present in cassettes containing
      bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-6), bla(IMP-7), bla(IMP-10), and bla(IMP-11) and unrelated to
      that present in cassettes containing bla(IMP-2) and bla(IMP-8). IMP-12 was
      overproduced in E. coli by using a T7-based expression system and was purified by
      cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. Kinetic analysis
      revealed that, like other IMP variants, IMP-12 exhibits an overall preference for
      cephalosporins and carbapenems rather than for penicillins and does not hydrolyze
      temocillin and aztreonam. However, IMP-12 also exhibits some notable functional
      differences from other IMP variants, including uniformly poor activity toward
      penicillins (k(cat)/K(m) values, around 10(4) M(-1). s(-1)) and a remarkably high
      K(m) (around 900 micro M) for imipenem.

AB  - Background: Drug-resistance genes found in human bacterial pathogens are
      increasingly recognized in saprophytic Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) from
      environmental sources. The clinical implication of such environmental GNBs is
      unknown. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review to determine how often such
      saprophytic GNBs cause human infections. Methods: We queried PubMed for articles 
      published in English, Spanish, and French between January 2006 and July 2014 for 
      20 common environmental saprophytic GNB species, using search terms "infections,"
      "human infections," "hospital infection." We analyzed 251 of 1,275 non-duplicate 
      publications that satisfied our selection criteria. Saprophytes implicated in
      blood stream infection (BSI), urinary tract infection (UTI), skin and soft tissue
      infection (SSTI), post-surgical infection (PSI), osteomyelitis (Osteo), and
      pneumonia (PNA) were quantitatively assessed. Results: Thirteen of the 20 queried
      GNB saprophytic species were implicated in 674 distinct infection episodes from
      45 countries. The most common species included Enterobacter aerogenes, Pantoea
      agglomerans, and Pseudomonas putida. Of these infections, 443 (66%) had BSI, 48
      (7%) had SSTI, 36 (5%) had UTI, 28 (4%) had PSI, 21 (3%) had PNA, 16 (3%) had
      Osteo, and 82 (12%) had other infections. Nearly all infections occurred in
      subjects with comorbidities. Resistant strains harbored extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenemase, and metallo-beta-lactamase genes recognized
      in human pathogens. Conclusion: These observations show that saprophytic GNB
      organisms that harbor recognized drug-resistance genes cause a wide spectrum of
      infections, especially as opportunistic pathogens. Such GNB saprophytes may
      become increasingly more common in healthcare settings, as has already been
      observed with other environmental GNBs such as Acinetobacter baumannii and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of Pseudomonas putida infection.
PG  - 754-61
AB  - The clinical and microbiologic characteristics of 55 cases of Pseudomonas putida 
      infection in 53 patients in a medical center in Taiwan from April 1988 to March
      1993 are reported. P. putida was cultured in the decreasing order of frequency
      from urine (24 isolates), sputum (12), blood (10), wound discharge (3),
      peritoneal fluid (3), cerebrospinal fluid (2) and umbilical swab (1). Of the
      adult patients, 23% (12/53) were considered to be contaminated or colonized with 
      P. putida. Of the 41 patients with manifest disease. 17 (41%) had urinary tract
      infections, 10 (24%) had pneumonia, 8 (19%) had septicemia, 3 (7%) had wound
      infections, 2 (5%) had meningitis and 1 (2%) had peritonitis. Of these, 55% were 
      nosocomial infections. The case fatality rate was 29% (12/41). There was no
      significant correlation between patient mortality and the type of disease caused 
      by the bacterium. Results of in vitro susceptibility tests suggested that
      imipenem and ceftazidime were more effective than other antimicrobials. This
      study indicates that the clinical spectrum of diseases caused by P. putida is
      broader and the incidence of true infection is higher than previously expected,
      especially among hospitalized patients who undergo invasive procedures such as
      placement of intravascular devices, urinary catheterization and intubation.

TI  - Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant isolates of pseudomonas
      putida producing VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase.
PG  - 4051-5
AB  - Successful carbapenem-based chemotherapy for the treatment of Pseudomonas
      infections has been seriously hindered by the recent appearance of IMP- and
      VIM-type metallo-beta-lactamases, which confer high-level resistance to
      carbapenems and most other beta-lactams. Recently, multidrug-resistant
      Pseudomonas putida isolates for which carbapenem MICs were >/=32 micro g/ml were 
      recovered from cultures of urine from three inpatients in the general intensive
      care unit of the Ospedale di Circolo, Varese, Italy. Enzyme assays revealed
      production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity, while molecular analysis
      detected in each isolate a bla(VIM-1) determinant carried by an apparently
      identical medium-sized plasmid. Conjugation experiments were unsuccessful in
      transferring the beta-lactamase determinant to Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. Macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
      demonstrated that the isolates were of clonal origin. PCR mapping and sequencing 
      of the variable region of the plasmid-borne class 1 integron carrying the
      bla(VIM-1) determinant (named In110) showed that the bla(VIM-1)-containing
      cassette was identical to that previously found in strains of different species
      from other Italian hospitals and that the cassette array of In110 was not
      identical but clearly related to that of In70 (a bla(VIM-1)-containing
      plasmid-borne integron from an Achromobacter xylosoxidans isolate), pointing to a
      common origin of this cassette and to a related evolutionary history of their
      cognate integrons.

      analysis of 4 cases].
PG  - 1523-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the strategy for management of urosepsis after
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). METHODS: The clinical data were
      analyzed in 4 cases of urosepsis caused by ESWL during the period from January,
      2008 to October 2011. RESULTS: Two of the patients had kidney stones and two had 
      ureteral stones. Analysis of urine bacterial culture revealed the presence of E. 
      coli in 2 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 case and Pseudomonas putida combined 
      E. coli in 1 case. All the 4 patients were monitored for ECG, blood pressure and 
      oxygen saturation, and received fluid replacement and anti-inflammatory therapy. 
      The vital signs of the patients became stable after 5-11 days (mean 6.75 days).
      Three patients underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy, and 1 patient had emergency
      ureteral stent indwelling. All the 4 patients were cured and discharged.
      CONCLUSION: ESWL is more likely to cause urosepsis in patients with ureteral
      stones and urinary infection, for which early nonsurgical interventions should be
      administered immediately after the diagnosis is established.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of urinary tract infection among
      patients at Messalata Central Hospital, Libya, to identify the causative
      bacteria, and to explore their resistance pattern to antimicrobials. METHODS: A
      total number of 1153 urine samples were collected from patients, who attended
      daily to Messalata Central Hospital, Libya, in a study extended for one year.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and isolates typing were done using Phoenix 
      BD (BD diagnostic). Resistance was confirmed manually using agar disk diffusion
      method. RESULTS: Of the 1153 urine samples tested, 160 (13.9%) samples were
      positive, from which 17 different, solely Gram negative, uropathogens were
      identified. Escherichia coli were the most prevalent (55.6%) bacteria, followed
      by Klebsiella pneumoniae subspecies pneumoniae (16.3%), Proteus mirabilis (6.3%),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.5%,
      each), Citrobacter koseri and Providencia rettgeri (1.9%, each), Acinetobacter
      baumannii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus vulgaris (1.3%, each), and
      Aeromonas caviae, Citrobacter freundii, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter
      amnigenus biogroup 2, Pseudomonas putida and Serratia marcescens (0.6%, each).
      The isolated uropathogens showed increased levels of resistance ranged from 10.5%
      to 64.5%, with an overall resistance of 28.9%. Amikacin was the most effective
      antimicrobial followed by Imipenem and Meropenem (0%, 0.6% and 2.5% resistance,
      respectively); while, Cephalothin and Ampicillin were the least (80.6% and 90.0% 
      resistance, respectively) effective. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results emphasized
      the emergence of highly resistant bacteria to most of tested antimicrobials and
      raise the alarm for physicians to change their treatment pattern depending on
      antimicrobial susceptibility results.

TI  - Adhesion of the positively charged bacterium Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas)
      maltophilia 70401 to glass and Teflon.
PG  - 5472-9
AB  - Medical implants are often colonized by bacteria which may cause severe
      infections. The initial step in the colonization, the adhesion of bacteria to the
      artificial solid surface, is governed mainly by long-range van der Waals and
      electrostatic interactions between the solid surface and the bacterial cell.
      While van der Waals forces are generally attractive, the usually negative charge 
      of bacteria and solid surfaces leads to electrostatic repulsion. We report here
      on the adhesion of a clinical isolate, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 70401, which 
      is, at physiological pH, positively charged. S. maltophilia has an
      electrophoretic mobility of +0.3 x 10(-8) m2 V-1 s-1 at pH 7 and an overall
      surface isoelectric point at pH 11. The positive charge probably originates from 
      proteins located in the outer membrane. For this bacterium, both long-range
      forces involved in adhesion are attractive. Consequently, adhesion of S.
      maltophilia to negatively charged surfaces such as glass and Teflon is much
      favored compared with the negatively charged bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt2.
      While adhesion of negatively charged bacteria is impeded in media of low ionic
      strength because of a thick negatively charged diffuse layer, adhesion of S.
      maltophilia was particularly favored in dilute medium. The adhesion efficiencies 
      of S. maltophilia at various ionic strengths could be explained in terms of
      calculated long-range interaction energies between S. maltophilia and glass or
      Teflon.

      birth was presented. The patient was admitted to the hospital with fever, and
      diagnosed as meningitis on the basis of physical examination and leukocytosis
      (blood: 16.380/mm3, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): 130/mm3; 90% PMNL). Following
      diagnosis ceftriaxone therapy was started led to improvement in clinical and
      laboratory findings. However on the 20th day, the clinical signs and symptoms
      became worse, and the patient was diagnosed to develop a second meningitis attack
      by laboratory examination of CSF. P. stutzeri was isolated from the CSF culture, 
      and the isolate was found to be resistant to ceftriaxone. Upon this result the
      therapy has changed to meropenem. On the 5th day of the therapy, the patient has 
      slightly improved and he was discharged due to the wishes of his parents, however
      he died two days after discharge. This first case of P. stutzeri meningitis in
      neonates was presented to withdraw attention to this clinical entity.

TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of uncommon bacterial species causing severe
      infections in Italy.
PG  - 253-60
AB  - This study presents the results of the italian "Severe infections project"
      involving bacteria that can be considered rare causes of disease. we isolated 30 
      uncommon human pathogens from a total of 60 strains (1.2% of all the isolates).
      The most frequent sources of uncommon human pathogens were primary bloodstream
      infections (48.3%) and pneumonia (20%). Species such as Comamonas testosteroni,
      Enterococcus hirae, Kluyvera ascorbata, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Leclercia
      adecarboxylata and Ochrobactrum anthropi were recovered from bacteremia patients.
      Clinically useful antimicrobial agents were tested against each isolate.
      Resistance to 4 or more antibiotics tested was found in Achromobacter
      xylosoxidans, O. anthropi, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Citrobacter braakii,
      Enterobacter sakazakii, K. ascorbata, Proteus penneri and Serratia plymuthica.
      About 16% of the Gram-negative species were resistant to third-generation
      cephalosporins and 28.6% of the staphylococci were oxacillin-resistant. the
      results from this study offer indications for empirical therapy for severe
      infections from uncommon human pathogens.
